ANNOUNCEMENT: REPRESENTING THE CITY ADMINISTRATION WILL BE CHIEF OF

STAFF KATHRYN ROOS

REPORTS OF CITY OFFICES - DEPUTY MAYOR MARK NEAL
The recent state of violence in our community is acceptable.  No parent should have to pay for
the death of their child. Our public safety officials are very focused, we appreciate your support
and all your efforts. We will be having more consistency on beets, to get to know the residences,
and increase with reporting. I will continue to urge all the community to report acts of violence,
and public safety they can call anonymously.

Other notes, our corridors plan there's been an effort in the budget that has been approved to
work on Western Ave. There will be a series of Public Meetings to April 21' -26th, we will also
be using our city voice application (to leave phone messages to give your feedback). We also
want to highlight our police and firefighters who honored officers who serve our community.
We appreciate hundreds of volunteers for rehabilitating the houses. Finally, we would like to
recognize our Public Works employees, over hundreds of them were honored for the great job
they did during last winter and cleaning our streets, and helping with our solid waste.

Councilmember Dieter- You mentioned the law enforcement side, as I said for years on the city
council we need to increase in beets and police personnel, so thank you for that

Councilmember Dr. Varner - The city police applications that they use for surveys it's important
that the results are reported. I think too often information is cleaned and not reported.

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 14, 2014

Councilmember Dr. Ferlic- Has there be any progress on the alley issue, or has Eric or any
people been involved to try and solve that if we have another bad winter like this year? Deputy
Mayor responded we are continue to look at our solid waste pick up activities, how we do it to
serve residence better, I would ask you to stay tuned we should have more about that in the next
thirty (30) to sixty (60) days.

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. I am in full agreement with you that the violence needs to stop,
I attended church yesterday, and my Pastor spoke about the same thing. I don't think we think
about what options there are for the people once they stop or who want to stop. I think when we
have these conversations about violence I think we need to find solutions, so you will hear next
Council meeting to discuss those things. We are missing out on our neighborhood centers,
ensuring the staff is adequate, that programing is at a higher level and usage. Where is our
partnerships with the school corporation, how do we allow them to use their facilities on the
weekend and how they can be used for the kids, whether a computer lab or gymnasium? I think
we are selling ourselves short when we say quit the violence, there needs to be an end goal in
mind besides incarceration. We still have to take care our people and need to change the culture
of our city. Deputy Mayor responded I agree with you, people must put their guns down,
violence must stop. At the same time we need to help find alternatives, training for employment
and job skills employment.

At 7:23 p.m. Councilmember Dieter made a motion to resolve into the Committee of the Whole.

this afternoon on this bill and send bill 23 -14 to the full Council with a favorable

Presenter: Ramos- 2224 West Ave South Bend- I have 13 years living in this area, two years ago,
I came to get permission to connect multiple lots.

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the above bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard.

There being no one present wishing to speak to the Council either in favor of or in opposition to

AND OTHER CONTAINERS DESIGNED TO ACCEPT

OR TO DISTRIBUTE USED ITEMS

Councilmember Schey, Chairperson, Personnel &  Finance Committee, reported that they met

Council Attorney Kathy motion to hear substitute bill 18 -14 before the Council.  So moved by

Presenter: Anne Nash- 1951 East St South Bend- I have spoken with Goodwill and other
donation spots.  I have worked with Goodwill for many years, as I mentioned this afternoon we
collect gifts for those who are in need. We have several organizations that have taken donations
so we can do that. We are providing a licensing to incorporate with the theme already and
posting the names of the organization and the boxes be empty regularly and a person to contact

4

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 14, 2014

for complaints about overloading. I provided some specific language for the collection box to
Council Attorney Kathy Farrand. I would be happy answer any questions.

Councilmember Dieter- are we going to come up with a tag for each? Petitioner- we fixed the
languages that are in front of you, to include the license of the city for the collection box, and the
date that it would expire. Councilmember Dieter- would those be number with location?
Petitioner- we would identify the place. Councilmember Dieter- would they be number so we
can coordinate a number with a location and for billing and code would they have a master list?
Petitioner- an auditor would most likely have that. Councilmember Dieter that would best for
them to have that for those who get the complaint.

Councilmember Scott- Would the additional cost of coming up with a sticker? Petitioner
responded audio was too low.

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. was that per box, or was that per organization? Petitioner
responded per box. Councilmember Davis was there a thought that the lock that holds the box,
the person who owns the land for the box would be more accountable as they usually have more
of an invested interest. I think it would be cleaner if the people who owns the land would keep it
a lot cleaner? I don't know, but I don't agree in assigned new fees to different things. Petitioner
responded that some were held accountable in the past. Councilmember Davis they use to have
an illegal dumping team are they engaged in this process? Petitioner, if someone was found
doing illegal dumping we were able to call the city against that person, unfortunately without the
locks we can't find out who did the illegal dumping.

Betty- President of the organization- I do have pictures, donations boxes are the life blood of our
organization because what we get in those boxes is what we use for revenue.  The agency that we
work with none of us get local dollars. If you look to the west of community you had one that
was tipped over and for weeks and part of the time you couldn't get to it because of all the snow.
As we are looking to clean up our city we don't want that to be the first thing people see when
entering our city. I ask for your consideration, we are happy to pay the fee for the boxes, we
have to offer the landlords who are not in our community, we have to get permission from the
landlord, they're not local it would be easier for the organization to maintain and license them.

Councilmember Henry Davis- do you have to pay renters insurance for them? Petitioner, yes we
have to pay a fee to put our box down. Councilmember Davis- so you think the fee should be
higher? Petitioner- no I think the fee at $25 is affordable, but I think the organization should pay
that fee, to make sure that it is clean. Councilmember Davis- I just don't see a huge investment
in $25 to help change my behavior, I don't think that should be adopted, it makes you think twice
about your responsibility if the fee is higher than $25, that box is on second district, local car lot
dealer, sees it every day and walks right pass it.

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the above bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard.

Those wishing to speak in favor:

Lima Henderson- recently moved here from Michigan- we are one of the location organization
who collect in this area, we have over 600 bins, and we have done this for 7 to 8 years.  We got
our permit for one of our cities, it's not a very complicated ordinance that we full support, and
we train and send volunteers that work in Africa from the proceeds from these bins. Last year
my organization diverted 2 million tons away from the mid -west landfill to families to reuse.
70% of the world's population cannot afford to go in to this stores and buy this clothing. These
are very important for an equal opportunity for those less advantaged.  The fee is with the
organization, we are a non -profit we don't pay a fee, people do this out of the goodness of their
hearts that burden should be with us. What we do is charitable, what we do is good and it is
important to support our community. We are favor in such legislation. Thank you.

Bryan- we support the boxes, we need to have something that South Bend has control to make
sure they are clean and having a for -profit organization, we have some of the ordinances that we
provide and have done this for larger and smaller cities, and have worked with city councils to

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 14, 2014

make sure it is advantageous to everyone in the city and the organization.  We are here weekly to
maintain our boxes, however we don't reside in the city but we need to make sure the
organization is regulating the boxes, so the owner kicks them out or the box providers get fines
or termination of permit. We are support of it what certain language in there.

Anthony- Manager ofa Homeless Center in Michigan- I support non - profit organization that are
building stronger communities that help with poverty. We are here twice a month, we help those
to read, and getting books. We do have a presence in this city beyond our blue boxes.

Those wishing to speak in opposition:

Robert Townsend- Planet A- I work as part-time employer, he provided them with brochures.
The Portage reference, he referred to our company worked hard with council to make that
possible. We only have one chance to pass things like this. You should take this bill back to the
organization, tag the boxes for them.

Henry James - Planet A- this is the first opportunity that we heard about this, I don't like the
parking because the people who don't own the boxes don't care what kind of sticker is on the
boxes. By putting any fee on the owner of the box will change nothing, it will just get dumped. I
think something's are appropriate and good. I think you should have permits for the boxes, it is
important the box identifies who they are, and their purpose, there should a phone number on the
box. Someone can junk outside, someone could take care of it. Some might need to be picked up
every day or the days that they come. Thank you to all the organizations that clean them up

Rebuttal - the people from Planet A please note the language in the ordinance would require that
they live or have a business within St. Joseph County. They can easily have a responsible person
in this county or an adjacent count and monitor it at least every seven (7) days. We as an
organization can manage the boxes should they not have a local home. Under Section 4 -15 a $50
fine can issue a fine, they can suspend, or revoke them.

Councilmember Dieter made a motion for favorable recommendation to full Council concerning
this bill. Councilmember Scott seconded the motion which carried by a roll call vote of seven
7) ayes and (2) nays Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. and Councilmember Schey.

RISE AND REPORT

of deputy bonds for the correctional facility for the employment process on a preliminary basis.

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 14, 2014

This project would bring 50 new jobs to the plant, unlike other bonds the city is not liable of the
bonds. The resolution proposes a max bond amount of $25 million dollars to proceed to the
completion we would return to the Council a detailed bond, we ask for your favorable
recommendation.

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr- what time frame are you looking at for the bonds? Petition in
the next couple of months.

Councilmember White- As a matter of public record for the sake of our guest there is absolutely
no liability on the city's part should the company default. Petitioner if in fact the bonds were
issued and they were a default there is no pledge of revenue from the city. Councilmember White
since this is a for -profit company seeking a non -profit status that is allowable by law? Petitioner -
the federal government has provided certain types of financing permitted to be issued on a tax
basis, the portions of the facility that the equipment will be devoted to meets solid waste
requirements, federal IRS will be provided on a tax exempt basis and to encourage this type of
facility.

Councilmember Henry Davis, Jr. - there was a national publication that there is a company
invested in ethanol, could this have an adverse effect on a bylaw? Petitioner - the city has no
revenue impact, many bonds are sold with a line of credit, the legal term it is a conduit, and the
city is just lending its name on it. In investing in Ethanol that is inaccurate, having that plant in
operation has numerous benefits to the city. Is there a cap on economic bonds such as these or
are we able to extend more? Petitioner - the state does have a cap and the credit line of the
company, to complete the process the company would request an allocation from a finance
authority. There is a number on that cap. It is per state, not per city.

This being the time heretofore set for the Public Hearing on the above bill, proponents and
opponents were given an opportunity to be heard.

There being no one present wishing to speak to the Council either in favor of or in opposition to

COMMENTS ON THE VIOLENCE IN THE CITY
Jesse Davis- P.O. BOX 10205- I'm here talk about the violence in our city. I sat in on a meeting
and found it funny and alarming that there was 41 shootings in one weekend. There were
approximately units on the 19 street and of those how many are on duty, and who is on the
street? I got calls that there are police just sitting in parking lots, if you are going to bum fuel

42

REGULAR MEETING

APRIL 14, 2014

anyway shouldn't you burn your fuel in a neighborhood that you're supposed to be in and make
your presence known. Police Officers shouldn't be idle.

Andrew Brown- Citizens United for Better Government- I'm speaking on behalf of the violence
in our city. A lot of these kids it is not as easy to stop them as we don't have any connections
with them, we cannot give up them. We need to get some concrete ideas on how we can come
together. We have a group of kids at the Robertson center, these kids are 12 years old, are these
kids really safe? Keep working on these things.

Henry James- 18739- to continue what Mr. Brown was saying I hope that you support these
centers and parks, the violence has to stop. I was able to stop a violent situation as I heard
arguing and was able to prevent guns from being fired as the police was already there.  If you
hear noise call. On a different note you can put up a stop clock so we can see it so we know how
much time we have left when speaking.  We should update the technology for our city Council.

Councilmember Dr. Ferlic- you can talk to Tim Scott about those issues.

ADJOURNMENT
There being no further business to come before the Council, President Oliver Davis adjourned
the meeting at 8:53 p.m.
