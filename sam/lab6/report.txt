I found significant trouble implementing a web scraper in C++; at some point I
felt as though I was simply copying code and didn't really understand it --
especially when I was trying to store the website data in the program. When I
switched to python, I was able to get a lot farther especially in parsing
through the json data of the southbend open data site. Unfortunately, I could
not figure out how to get the actual data out of the websites; all I could get
was the metadata. I could determine how many records there were in a given table
and what the data field names were, but I could not find any of the actual
records in the json data. Thus, this is being pushed into a 'next step' phase
of the project.
