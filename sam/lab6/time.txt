Time spent                  Description

3/19/17 12:00 - 2:00pm      Worked on a C++ implementation of a web scraper, but
        2 hours             quickly found that I did not entirely understand
                            what I was coding. I completed a C++ implementation
                            of the Unix curl command before switching to python.


3/20/17 6:00 - 8:30pm       Created a scraper in Python that pulls back all the
        2.5 hours           different databases and lets the user select which
                            one they would like to see a description of. It then
                            goes back to that database and grabs the description
                            off of it to present to the user.
