Milestones for spring break, final project

Tasks I plan on completeing over break:

- 1-2 hours of research on innovative solutions other cities have found using their open data (10 points)
- Importing data from the South Bend open data platform using python. (10 points)
- Displaying that data in a raw format, that makes it clear enough to understand the data (20 points)
