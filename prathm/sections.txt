About:

South Bend Citizens Connect is a platform built to change the way residents interact with their local governments. The idea is simple: local government's are meant to represent resident interests, but the way we communicate with our representatives hasn't caught up to the times. No longer are town-halls and city surveys efficient. We need a way for members of the community to quickly report their issues and follow up on their community, and SBCC is just that platform.

SBCC is built to help you communicate with your Common Council and Local Representatives, but it's also a platform for them to keep you updated on their own meetings and actions. It's a comprehensive, ever growing, citizen- centered means for civic engagement and staying in touch.


Learn:

Citizens Connect is powered with a comprehensive Natural Language Processing software that automatically downloads, summarizes, and posts meeting minutes and agendas from Common Council meetings. This way you don't have to read the entire set of minutes to stay in the loop, just a short summary. It's all automated, so the summaries are not perfect, but they're informative and specific enough to give you an idea of what the Council speaks about at their meetings. 

Contribute:

The most important part of Citizens Connect is that you can get involved. Through our platform, you can directly get in touch with your respective Common Council members and send them any information, complaints, or questions you have. Your message will be sent directly to their Inbox, and they'll be able to respond to you through that. This way regardless of your City concerns, they'll be sent straight to the people who can solve them.
