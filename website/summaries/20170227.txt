Now, their suggestion of replacing and coming back to them with a COA for a flat roof —well, once again, if the roof you told me I could do was incorrect, why do I have to foot the bill? If the flat roof was the first roof that you wanted, that' s what you should have asked for

  29  REGULAR MEETING  FEBRUARY 27, 201  So,  when you have a hole in the roof, and you need to undertake''  ome emergency repair to preserve the rest of the building, and you are permitted to depart from a standard of one ( 1)  material to another — that' s a rather small accommodation —as opposed to with that metal roof permit, saying, " I' m going to put on an addition, and now I' m going to put on a peaked roof..."  When you buy a historic home or building like this, it' s light fixtures, it's window frames, it' s trim pieces,  it' s things that sometimes might seem}  ridiculous, but that' s what goes along with this historic landmark or historic home

If the City accidentally authorized and permitted a gabled roof rather than a flat roof, the HPC failed to prepare and issue an individual Historic Preservation Plan, as required by the same ordinance

Boyd stated, Now, the Historic Preservation Commission was given a flat roof quote, which I have shown you

However, HPC approved the change from a flat roof to a pitched metal roof on November 10,  2011

Regarding the policies and procedures —which he states they don' t have to do a Preservation Plan for each landmark —page seven ( 7),  if you turn it from the bottom onto page eight ( 8),  it says, " they are required to develop Historic Preservation Plans for historic landmarks and districts together with other public and private agencies to assist in the administration and  implementation of such plans."  That' s each landmark

I explained to her that it needed a roof and she said, " Well, what kind of a roof are you considering ?" and I said, " Metal."  If you look on that permit, it says, " Metal."  This building never had a metal roof

The HPC is granted authority through the ordinances that this Council has put into effect to consider and either grant or deny an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness for its properties in historic districts or properties which are historic landmarks

Boyd speaks of was not in regards to approving a newfangled gabled roof on this historic landmark

The HPC guidelines ordinance,  which I have referenced before,  requires HPC to develop a Historic Preservation Plan for landmarks and assist in the implementation of such plans
