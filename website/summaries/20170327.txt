  RESOLUTIONS  17 -15  A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL INDIANA,  OF THE CITY OF SOUTH BEND,  URGING THE INDIANA STATE LEGISLATURE,  OUR GOVERNOR AND ALL UNITED STATES SENATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLES OF INDIANA TO JOIN WITH OUR COMMUNITY AND PASS LEGISLATION TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF VIOLENT CRIMINALS, DOMESTIC ABUSERS AND SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL PERSONS BY CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES IN THE FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM AND STRENGTHENING STATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS  Councilmember Oliver Davis made a motion to accept Substitute Bill No

She stated that it might be better to look at the 88, 000, 000 as " something we have to make up for because of a bad judgment, or financial or economic circumstances."  She stated,  So,  rather than, in my mind, looking at it as a rate subsidy  15  REGULAR MEETING  MARCH 27,  2017  over time, it' s more about how are we going to fix this? The only thing I' m really concerned about is when you said at the beginning, " We' re kind of in a mode where we' re going to have to fix it when it breaks."

He stated that if the City approved of a new development for which it must pay $ 1, 000, 000 in running water, " we can make those decisions in the future to use TIF dollars for water."  He stated that the plan was a result of trying to compromise with the needs of some of the Councilmembers who wanted to see TIF dollars used along with a phased -in rate

 Instead of doing elevated tanks, we are going to keep with the operation scheme that they have set up current, and we will do some of the pumps in booster stations and try to make sure that some of these booster stations are up to speed and that our ground service tanks are in good shape

 Chief Cox gave kudos to the community —as this project saw the most community input of any project he had been a part of —and gave recognition to Dave Relos of the Department of Community Investment, who worked behind the scenes and did a lot of the negotiating for the project
