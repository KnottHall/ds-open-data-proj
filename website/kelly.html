  	<div id="bio">
  		<p>Randy Kelly was born and raised in South Bend. While living in Chicago after his graduation from the University of Notre Dame with a degree in Communications and Theatre, he chose to return to South Bend to raise a family. He makes his home here with his wife, Jory, and their youngest daughter Jaynie.  His two older daughters, Breanna and Maeve, currently attend IU Bloomington after graduating from the International Baccalaureate program at John Adams High School.</p>
  		<p>Prior to joining the Montessori faculty in 2012, Randy spent 10 years working in downtown South Bend with jobs in banking and nonprofit and community development, and also served on the South Bend Common Council for three months in 2007, filling a vacancy left by his father’s passing. He served on the Century Center Board of Managers, the South Bend Education Foundation Board of Directors, and the Martin Luther King Foundation. He also graduated from the St. Joseph County Chamber of Commerce Leadership program.</p>
  		<p>From working with at-risk teens in an alternative school in the Chicago area, to spending years coaching gymnasts aged 8 to 18; pursuing a teaching career always remained in the back of Randy’s mind. The chance to realize it at The Montessori Academy is an opportunity for which Randy is very grateful.  He will begin his teacher training at the Cincinnati Montessori Secondary Teacher Education Program in the summer of 2013.</p>
